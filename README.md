I've been using Jekyll Bootstrap (JB) to host my GitHub Page for a while until the new release of Jekyll 3.0. Jekyll Bootstrap really made everything easy and nice then. Unfortunately there are conflicts between Jekyll Bootstrap v0.3.0 (2012) and the new release of Jekyll 3.0. And it seems that the developer of JB
will not fix the issue recently.

GitHub Page turned to Jekyll 3.0 for a while, and my blog was gone because the conflict issue. In order to bring it back, I finally decided to try to build my personal blog site with Jekyll 3.0 myself.

I'd like to make it a simple and clean one. So everything here starts from running 'jekyll new' command. The default appearance looks good for me, however I'd like to do some customizations.
